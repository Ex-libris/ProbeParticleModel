This is implementation of efficient and simple model for simulation of
High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning probe microscopy (STM)
and inelastic tunneling microscopy (IETS) images using classical forcefileds. 

There are two versions of the code:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item currently developed Python/C++ version in PyProbe\_nonOrtho (branch master
    );
        to get quick esence of this model you can also try web interface hostet here: http://nanosurf.fzu.cz/ppr/
        for more details see wikipage:
        https://github.com/ProkopHapala/ProbeParticleModel/wiki
   \item Legacy fortran version in SHTM\_springTip2 (branch fortran );
        more detailed description o the fortran version is here:
