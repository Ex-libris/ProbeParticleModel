# Probe Particle Model

This is implementation of efficient and simple model for simulation of High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning probe microscopy (STM) and inelastic tunneling microscopy (IETS) images using classical forcefileds.

There are two versions of the code - 

currently developed Python/C++ version in PyProbe_nonOrtho 
Legacy fortran version in SHTM_springTip2
