# Probe Particle Model

This is implementation of efficient and simple model for simulation of High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning probe microscopy (STM) and inelastic tunneling microscopy (IETS) images using classical forcefileds.

There are two versions of the code - 

* currently developed Python/C++ version in PyProbe_nonOrtho  (branch *master* ); 
* * to get quick esence of this model you can also try web interface hostet here: http://nanosurf.fzu.cz/ppr/
* Legacy fortran version in SHTM_springTip2 (branch *fortranr* ); 
* * for more details see wikipage: https://github.com/ProkopHapala/ProbeParticleModel/wiki
